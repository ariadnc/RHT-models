# RHT-models

This repository contains the code developed and used in Master’s thesis:
“A numerical investigation of radiative heat transfer in methane and hydrogen opposed-flow diffusion flames with varying oxidizer composition.”

**LBL**: Line-by-Line (LBL) radiation model implementation.

**WSGG**: Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) radiation model implementation.

The code is only to compute radiative heat transfer properties (emissivity, absorption coefficient and radiative source term) form .csv or .xlsx files from CHEMKIN.
