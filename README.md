# RHT-models

This repository contains the code developed and used in the Master’s thesis:

**“A numerical investigation of radiative heat transfer in methane and hydrogen opposed-flow diffusion flames with varying oxidizer composition.”**

## Contents

- **LBL**: Line-by-Line (LBL) radiation model implementation.  
- **WSGG**: Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) radiation model implementation.  

Both codes are designed to compute **radiative heat transfer properties**, including:  
- Emissivity  
- Absorption coefficient  
- Radiative source term  

Input data is read from `.csv` or `.xlsx` files generated by **CHEMKIN** simulations.
